            <div class="about-text" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>Growing up in the vibrant suburb of Mckinnon in Melbourne, Australia, I spent my childhood surrounded
                    by adventure and curiosity. I loved playing basketball and catching the waves while surfing. In
                    2015, I made a significant move to Canada, which has been my home ever since. From a young age, I
                    was captivated by technology, often dismantling anything I could get my hands on just to understand
                    how it worked before putting it back together. In fact, the first time I "solved" a Rubik's cube, I
                    did so by pulling it apart and carefully reassembling the pieces.</p>

            <div class="about-text" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>I once dreamed of becoming a heart surgeon, even delivering a Grade 6 graduation speech on it. I
                    quickly realized my passion lay in engineering. I began coding, creating small apps and games on
                    Scratch, and developing my skills through hands-on experimentation. Over the years, my passion only
                    deepened, leading me to enroll in computer science classes both in and out of high school. This
                    journey sparked the creation of apps like "Battle of the Bands" – an iOS strategy game where players
                    tactically command units like Woodwinds, Brass, and Percussion – and "Trivia Time," an
                    exam-preparation app for high school courses.</p>

                <p>After high school, I planned to attend Monash University in Australia for a Bachelor of Engineering
                    with honors, but the COVID-19 pandemic shifted my path. I stayed in Canada and enrolled at McMaster
                    University for Software Engineering. My time at McMaster has been incredibly rewarding; I got
                    involved with the McMaster Engineering Society, serving as a First-Year Representative and
                    organizing events like hackathons to foster community engagement. I also took on the role of a
                    Welcome Week Rep, helping incoming students transition smoothly into university life. Now set to
                    graduate in April 2025, I'm excited to continue building my career in software engineering, blending
                    creativity with problem-solving.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="about-text" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>My journey in the working world kicked off with a thrilling start as a Rides Operator at Canada's
                    Wonderland. Talk about an epic first job! I got an insider's look at how those intricate roller
                    coasters functioned. It was fascinating to be part of the team that made the magic happen. I gained
                    an appreciation for the complexity behind every twist, turn, and loop. Plus, it wasn’t just about
                    pushing buttons—it was learning how safety systems worked, managing crowd control, and mastering the
                    art of a perfect “enjoy the ride!” wave. Not to mention, I got to experience the joy (and sometimes
                    terror) on people’s faces firsthand.</p>

            <div class="about-text" data-aos="fade-up">
                <p>From there, I switched gears to something even closer to my heart: a camp counselor at a coding camp.
                    This job was easily one of my favorites. Imagine spending your days teaching eager kids how to code
                    while watching them struggle, understand, and finally break into smiles of triumph—just like I did
                    when I first started out. It was incredibly rewarding to see them grow and share that spark of
                    excitement I had for tech. Plus, I got to brush up on my own skills in the process (turns out,
                    explaining recursion to an 8-year-old is harder than you'd think!).</p>

                <p>Next came my role at Gore Mutual, which was originally supposed to last just four months. But hey, I
                    guess they liked my passion, work ethic, and dedication because I ended up staying there for over
                    two and a half years! It was an amazing experience working in such a dynamic environment, learning
                    the ropes of corporate life, and applying my problem-solving skills to real-world challenges. This
                    job helped me sharpen my time management, communication, and technical skills, all while giving me a
                    sense of pride in the impact I was making. It was like leveling up in a game, one project at a time.

                    inventory magic. It was a whirlwind of packing boxes, promoting research in schools, and ensuring
                    financial records were shipshape. This job not only strengthened my organizational skills but also
